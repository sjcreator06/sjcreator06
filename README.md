Welcome to my universe of projects 🚀

From orbiting planets as a kid with my solar system model to building exoplanet models in Python, my passion for space has only grown stronger. I'm Samuel — an Aerospace Engineering student designing futuristic rovers, medevac wings, and solar sail spacecraft systems. I blend engineering with creativity, code with CAD, and vision with precision.

## 🧠 Areas of Focus

- 🛩️ **Aerospace Engineering** – From rockets to rovers, I thrive on building what flies and drives.
- 🔬 **FEA & Simulation** – SolidWorks, Onshape, and stress testing carbon fiber components.
- 🤖 **Robotics & Prototyping** – Servo gimbals, emergency mechanisms, and Arduino-based automation.
- 🪐 **Astronomy & Research** – Discovered and modeled an exoplanet (TOI 3779.01) classified as a Hot Jupiter.
- 📸 **Photography & Design** – Portfolio includes architectural and product design captures.
- ✍️ **Blogger @ [spacecore.world](https://spacecore.world)** – I write about rockets, planets, and engineering insight.
